We followed following Coding Standard

Code must be indented according to its nesting level.
The body of a function must be indented with respect to its header; the body of a for, while, or switch statement must be indented with respect to its first line; and similarly for if statements and other nested structures.
The amount of indentation should be consistent. A default tab character (eight spaces) is too much: three or four spaces is sufficient.
Most editors and programming environments allow you to set the width of a tab character appropriately

Maximize visibility of the different blocks by having curly braces alone on their line of code

Names that contain multiple words are either separated by a delimiter, such as underscore, or by using an upper case letter at the beginning of each new word
Each class declaration should have a comment explaining what the class is for.
Each method or function should have comments explaining what it does and how it works, as well as what is the purpose of its parameters
User-defined type names or class names start with a capital letter
Constants are named with upper case letters and may include underscores.

For readability purpose, blank lines can be added to separate code components/sections.
Places where a blank line is often a good idea:
between method declarations in a class declaration;
between variable declarations in a class declaration;
between major sections of a long and complicated function.

Example
public class Dog
{
   String breed;
   int ageC
   String color;

   void barkingDog()
   {
   
   }
   
   void hungryDog()
   {
   
   }
   
   void sleepingDog()
   {
   
   }
}
